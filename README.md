# predicting-air-pollution-climate
My 5-week capstone project whilst doing General Assembly's Data Science Immersive bootcamp in London. I used climate data from years 2011 to 2020 to predict PM10 and PM2.5 air particulates concentration in London Kensington. I used various regression models and climate data from WeatherSource and particulate data from uk.gov's AURN archive.
